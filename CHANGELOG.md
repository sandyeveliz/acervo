# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Architecture
- **S1 Unified pipeline** — Combined topic classification + entity extraction in a single LLM call, replacing the separate L3 topic classifier and ConversationExtractor. Runs ALWAYS on every turn; L1/L2 are hints, not gates.
- **S1.5 Graph Update** — Async post-response graph curation that merges duplicates, corrects types, discards garbage entities, creates missing relations, and extracts knowledge from assistant responses.
- **Single model architecture** — One fine-tuned model (`acervo-extractor-qwen3.5-9b`) handles both chat and extraction, differentiated by system prompt. Halves VRAM usage from ~14GB to ~6GB. Separate extractor model still configurable via `[acervo.models.extractor]`.
- **Trace persistence** — Pipeline events persist to JSONL file and restore on frontend reconnection.
- **History windowing** — Conversation history trimmed to N recent turns when graph context is present (configurable `history_window`).
- **Tool-continuation context** — Proxy re-injects enriched context across multi-turn tool call sequences.

### Fine-tuned Model
- Published `acervo-extractor-qwen3.5-9b` on Hugging Face.
- Trained on 612 examples across 5 domains (software, business, literature, personal, academic).
- 85% extraction accuracy, 100% JSON parse rate.
- Supports English and Spanish input natively.
- Training code and datasets in `acervo-models` repository.

### Data Model
- **Unified entity types**: 8 types (person, organization, project, technology, place, event, document, concept).
- **Unified relation types**: 15 controlled relations (uses_technology, part_of, maintains, deployed_on, etc.).
- **Entity layering**: PERSONAL (user owns it) vs UNIVERSAL (public knowledge) classification per entity.
- **Fact dedup**: Jaccard word-overlap similarity (threshold 0.65, was 0.9) catches more paraphrases.
- **Edge dedup + upgrade**: Prevents duplicate edges; generic relations (`related_to`) auto-upgrade to specific ones (`uses_technology`).
- **Type migration on graph load**: Framework → technology, Backend_service → technology, etc.
- **Garbage entity filter**: Blocks jargon like index names, SQL terms, file extensions.

### Storage
- **ChromaVectorStore** — Activated embedding-based semantic search over graph facts and file chunks. Optional dependency (`pip install acervo[vector]`).
- **Embedding optimization** — Batch embedding via Ollama's multi-input API. User text embedding deduplicated (topic L2 + vector search share one call). ~10 sequential HTTP calls → 2 per turn.
- **Data directory** moved to `.acervo/` in project workspace (follows `.git/` pattern).
- `/acervo/clear` endpoint — Atomic reset that drops ChromaDB client before deleting vectordb (fixes Windows file lock issues).

### Prompts
- New `s1_unified.txt` — Minimal system prompt for the fine-tuned extraction model.
- Updated `s1_5_graph_update.txt` — Aligned with new type/relation vocabulary, added valid relations list.
- Updated `extractor_search.txt` — Added layer guards (UNIVERSAL only), aligned entity schema with `id` field.
- Prompt files loaded from `.acervo/prompts/` with built-in defaults as fallback.

### Proxy
- **Graceful client disconnect handling** — Catches `ConnectionResetError` and `ClientConnectionResetError` during streaming instead of crashing.
- **Provider-friendly error messages** — Connection errors show the configured provider name.
- **Per-role model support** — `[acervo.models.extractor]` and `[acervo.models.summarizer]` for different models per pipeline step.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed clear button bringing back old data — proxy's in-memory facade survived disk deletion; now fully reinitializes on reset.
- Fixed S1.5 using wrong model (default instead of fine-tuned extractor).
- Fixed S1.5 LLM params (temperature 0.0→0.1, max_tokens 1000→2048).
- Fixed search extractor using fine-tuned model instead of default LLM.
- Fixed double embedding in entity enrichment — `facade.py` called `embed()` redundantly before `index_facts()`.
- Fixed stale vector DB data surviving graph deletion.
- Fixed ChromaDB file locks on Windows during data clear.
- Fixed proxy crash on client disconnect during streaming.

### Removed
- `query_planner.py` — Logic folded into S1 Unified + deterministic context gathering.
- `topic_classifier.txt` and `extractor_conversation.txt` — Replaced by S1 Unified.
- `_extract_label_via_llm()` and `_match_known_topic()` — Replaced by S1 Unified.
- L3 LLM topic classification branch — S1 makes the final topic decision.
- Automatic `co_mentioned` edge creation — Too noisy, replaced by S1.5 explicit relations.
- `cycle_status()` — Replaced by topic-aware `update_status()`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-18

- Documentation rewrite to reflect only working v0.1.1 features
- Planned features clearly badged as "Planned" throughout docs

### Added
- Roadmap page with planned features and their status
- Mermaid diagrams across docs (pipeline flow, graph structure, context stack, layers)
- CHANGELOG backfill for v0.1.0 and v0.1.1

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
